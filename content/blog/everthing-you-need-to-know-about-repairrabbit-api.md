## What is RepairRabbit API?

An application programming interface (API) is an overloaded word. In general terms, it is a set of defined methods and protocols to communicate with different components of the software. It allows software to communicate with other software/applications. For example:- Yelp shows restaurants on Google Map. At that time Yelp communicated with Google map through the API by passing restaurant details to Google map. So that Google can plot restaurants as pins on their map.

## Why should you use it?

The API is how two software components can communicate. By allowing anyone to create a new presentation layer—like an app, a website, or a widget—APIs can be used to distribute services and information to new audiences. Thus it allows the content to be shared and distributed easily. Using API one can customize the content and services as per its requirements. One can migrate data from different systems and keep it safe and secured at a place.

## What all problems does it solve?
