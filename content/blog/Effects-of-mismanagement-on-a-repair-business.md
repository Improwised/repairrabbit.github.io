Mismanagement, less organized processes, lack of planning, etc. together lead to many disadvantages. Sometimes due to mismanagement organization has to suffer through major revenue loss. And in today's competitive market, companies cannot afford revenue loses. Thus, it's quite necessary to work according to roadmaps and achievable plans.

## As we disscussed about <a href="/blog/mismanagement-in-a-repair-business-and-its-causes" target="_blank">mismanagement in a repair business</a> previously, it's time to know its effects.

### Reduced Productivity 

If employers fail to notice or act upon, occasions where employees are failing to meet performance expectations, the situation could be worst and reduce levels of productivity across the workforce. Thus it is quite important to keep the records of work done by the technicians in a repair business. You need to assign work to your employees according to the roadmaps and plans you've set. This helps you to determine which tasks were assigned to which employee. And you can check the progress too.

### Reduced Profits 

In the worst-case scenario, mismanagement can impact a business’ profitability. No business will like to see any kind of revenue loss or a decrease in sales. This competitive market doesn't allow you to make any mistake which costs you revenue loss or decreased sales stats. But due to mismanagement, problems like decrease in sales do take place. This is because mismanagement effects bad services and business eventually lose its customers. Customers do not like it when you don't meet the deadlines. They will prefer to go to your competitor rather than giving you a second chance. Thus this can lead to a decrease in sales.

### High Retention of Employees

Unsurprisingly, one of the biggest effects of mismanagement is high employee turnover. Whether it’s an employer driving staff away through weak management skills or employees choosing to pursue a career elsewhere because they believe they will have a better chance to excel, high turnover rates can reduce productivity. It can affect employee's productivity and morale negatively. It can impact a company’s reputation as an undesirable place to work. If employees' productivity gets affected negatively it can result in delay in the completion of work and ultimately it will lead to dissatisfied customers.

### Impact on the Company's Reputation

When inadequate organization and lack of planning takes place, employees are not assigned work accordingly and it ultimately leads to delay in the completion of work. Thus, targets are not achieved it results in unpleasant customer services. If you're into a repair business, your customers will need to get their devices repaired as fast as possible but, if you make any kind of delay they will definitely not leave positive feedback and they'll not prefer or suggest you to any one of their contacts. This will leave a negative effect on the company's reputation. 

These effects directly hinder an organization's growth. Thus, it's quite essential to work on the processes and make them simpler and easier, so that employee retention rate can be controlled and they can work with positive morale which will avoid delay in completion of tasks. And ultimately it will help you to provide better customer services.
