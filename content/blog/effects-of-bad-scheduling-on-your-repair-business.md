Now a days cell phones are a very important part of everyone's life, people can hardly survive without their mobile phones for a single day as  they are the most used medium of communication with the help of internet, social media etc. And businesses have to take care of requirement of each and every customer. They will demand to complete the repair of their device as soon as possible or some of them will demand to complete the repair work on the spot. In this situation you can't accept every repair as they cannot be completed in short period of time. The customers will not wait for you to accept their device to be repaired. They will choose other technicians or repair shops for repairing their device. Thus it will ultimately lead to loss and negative effect on your goodwill. 

Even if you accept all the repair requests, you will eventually feel that you have overburdened your technicians, underestimated the time required for the completion of the repair, and possibly customers have been given the deadline that was too soon. This will result in to disastrous results. 

## Let's see what are the disadvantages of bad scheduling.

### Negative effect on the company's reputation. 

Due to bad scheduling, there are high chances of delay in the repair work. Thus your customers will not satisfied with your satisfied, if their devices are not repaired on the given time. They will have bad experience of your services and they'll surely don't recommend any one to visit you. It craetes a negative impact on your customers and this will ultimately lead to bad reputation in the market.

### Dissatisfied employees.

If there are many repairs to be done as you've accepted all the requests, you might don't realize that it can cause over burden to the employees. They need sufficient time to complete the task. And if you overburden them, it may create a negative impact in the work culture.

### Disorganised work schedule.

If you don't have list of appointments to work on, you'll suffer in organising the work and less organised road map can lead to delay in work and this will result into bad customer services. Disorganised work schedule can exhaust you as you suffer from multiple error due to lack of planning.
