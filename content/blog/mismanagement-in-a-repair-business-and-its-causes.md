Less effective work schedule, improper distribution of work among the employees etc are the factors which lead to disastrous results and poor management. If one organizes his processes well, poor organization can be ignored and errors can be avoided. Setting targets can help a business to measure its growth and work through a pre decided method.

### Lack Of Planning.

Delay in completion of repairs can destroy your goodwill and it ultimately results into revenue loss. And in this competitive market you cannot bear a monetary loss due to such errors which can be solved quite easily if one wishes. 

### Poor Data Management

A business in order survive, needs to retain its customer and its quite important to manage each customer's details at a place. If business owner wants to contact them again for updating about latest schemes and offers. If you have stored complete details of clients you can contact them with a hope that you'll get more business from them. Managing employee data is also an important task. This data includes records of repairs done by the employees, their leaves, salary slips etc. Businesses fail to supervise these areas which can be very harmful later on.

### Difficult processes for invoice and appointment.

A repair business has to work by scheduling appointments. As there are many repairs to work on, appointments should be processes should be easy so that work can be distributes among the employees and you can get clear idea about what to complete next. Businesses don't follow the proper appointment pattern and it leads to confusion about which repair to be completed by keeping in priority.
Invoice is an important factor. It is quite necessary to store invoices as they can be helpful as proof in future. If you have a simple and easy process for creating and sending invoices, it can be really time saving for your employees. But here too, businesses don't organize their appointment and invoice processes in a proper way, which leads to mismanagement.
