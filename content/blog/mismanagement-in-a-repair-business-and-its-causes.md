When you're into a repair business, there are lots of components and departments to supervise. For eg - Customer data, Employee Data, Financial accounts, Stock management, Appointments, Customer feedback section, and so on. And you cannot afford any major error in these areas. 

Business having multiple branches usually becomes the victim of mismanagement. It leads to disastrous results and sometimes a business has to shut doors. To survive in today's market you have to put your 100% efforts in organizing the processes. When it comes to increasing the company's revenue, you need to be organized properly and mismanagement cannot be afforded.

## There are many causes of Mismanagement, let's have a quick look at major ones.

### Poor Organization

Poor organization can be the most affecting factor in mismanagement. Less effective work schedule, improper distribution of work among the employees, etc. are the factors which lead to disastrous results and poor management. If one organizes his processes well, poor organization can be ignored and errors can be avoided. Setting targets can help a business to measure its growth and work through a pre-decided method.

### Lack Of Planning

Sometimes when you don't schedule your work and don't plan your roadmap, it becomes difficult to complete the tasks on time which later lead to delay in work and poor management. Delay in the completion of repairs can destroy your goodwill and it ultimately results in revenue loss. And in this competitive market, you cannot bear monetary loss due to such errors which can be solved quite easily if one wishes. 

### Poor Data Management

Business, in order to survive, needs to retain its customer and it's quite important to manage each customer's details at a place if a business owner wants to contact them again for updating about the latest schemes and offers. If you have stored complete details of clients you can contact them with a hope that you'll get more business from them. Managing employee data is also an important task. This data includes records of repairs done by the employees, their leaves, salary slips, etc. Businesses fail to supervise these areas which can be very harmful later on.

### Difficult processes for invoice and appointment

A repair business has to work by scheduling appointments. As there are many repairs to work on, the appointment process should be easy so that work can be distributed amongst the employees and you can get a clear idea about what to complete next. Businesses don't follow the proper appointment pattern and it leads to confusion about which repair to be completed by keeping in priority.
Invoice is an important factor. It is quite necessary to store invoices as they can be helpful as proof in the future. If you have a simple and easy process for creating and sending invoices, it can save time of your employees. But, businesses don't organize their appointment and invoice processes in a proper way, which leads to mismanagement.
